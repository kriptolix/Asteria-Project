"""
Public, frontend-agnostic API for Asteria.

Everything a UI needs -- the CLI, a GTK4 app, a test, a one-off script --
lives here as plain functions and classes that:

  * take/return real Python objects (Path, dataclasses, structured
    results), never text meant for a terminal;
  * never print anything and never call sys.exit();
  * never block on terminal input (no input() prompts -- a caller that
    needs a confirmation step, like the CLI's `asteria reset-theme`
    prompt, does that itself *before* calling in here);
  * report failures as exceptions (AsteriaError) or, for the long-running
    dev server, as callbacks -- never as a process exit code.

`cli.py` is a thin wrapper around this module: every command it exposes
just calls one of these functions and formats the result for a
terminal. Any other frontend (a GTK4 app, a script, a test) should
import straight from here instead of going through the CLI or shelling
out to `asteria ...` as a subprocess.

Threading note for GUI frontends: build_project/check_project/
clean_project/etc. are synchronous and do file I/O, so a GUI should
normally call them from a worker thread rather than its main/UI thread.
DevServer (see server.py) already runs its own work in background
threads and reports back through callbacks -- see its docstring for the
main-thread-marshalling caveat that applies to those callbacks.
